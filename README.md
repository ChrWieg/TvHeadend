Interface for TvHeadend - Solution for TV-Browser Capture-Plugin (Aufnahmesteuerung)

TvHeadend is a well working solution for recording tv. It has a quite good web interface. But I prefere TV-Browser for searching the tv program. Therefore I was looking for a way to schedule TvHeadend recordings with TV-Browser.

I've found a number of posts of users who where looking for the same, but nobody has provided a solution.

Then I've discovered the rest-api for TvHeadend! Thanks to dave-p: https://github.com/dave-p/TVH-API-docs/wiki

Here is the beta version for a command line tool, still under construction. It works with the TV-Browser Capture-Plugin (Aufnahmesteuerung).

I'm going to provide a short tutorial soon.
